                <p>Furniture is bulky and prone to transit friction. You <strong>must</strong> inspect the box for
                    visible damage before signing the delivery receipt. If the box is damaged, please write "Damaged
                    upon receipt" on the delivery slip.</p>

            <p>To be eligible for a return, the chair must be in its <strong>original packaging</strong> and

            <h2>3. Usage & Safety Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Our chairs are designed for specific weight capacities (noted on each product page). Using a chair as a
                step-ladder or exceeding the <strong>Static Weight Limit</strong> voids all warranties and releases us
                from liability for any resulting injury.</p>

        <section class="policy-section">
            <h2>4. Warranty</h2>
            <p>We provide a 1-year limited warranty on frames, springs, and pneumatic lifts. This does not cover
                "pilling" of fabrics or natural variations in wood grain or leather scarring.</p>
